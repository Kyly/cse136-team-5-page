        <p>
            As proud members of team Wecodeinourunderpants we have all taken a vow to code seven days a week. We will
            not let rain, snow, power outages, Game of Thrones season premieres or the apocalypse get in the way of us
            writing a bunch of code. We are all passionate about what we do and plan on making some awesome websites
            and enterprise applications in CSE 136 and for the rest of our careers. We plan on going the extra distance
            and learning as much as possible. Yes, we will come to school 5 days a week dressed like normal students but
            on the weekends and late nights when things really need to get done Wecodeinourunderpants.

                        <dd>Well I am in my final quarter as a UCSD student and it has been a great life experience. I
                            enjoy surfing at our local beaches and hiking in many of Americas national parks in my free
                            time. As far as CS I enjoy web technologies from design and front end to the backend and
                            databases. I have some experience in IT and some day I hope to have a small but profitable
                            company. I have a wonderful wife and plan on living in San Diego for the rest of my life.

                        <dd>I've been interested in computers and technology almost my whole life. At first I
                            was jumping around between being either an electronics engineer, a computer engineer,
                            or a software engineer because I was fascinated by both the metal and the code behind it.
                            Now I'm doing my last quarter as a CS major and striving to become a software engineer in
                            the future.
